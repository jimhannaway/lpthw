        "There are various special sequences you can use in regular expressions. They are written as a backslash followed by another character.\n",

        "More useful special sequences are __\\d, \\s, and \\w__.\n",
        "These match digits, whitespace, and word characters respectively.\n",
        "In ASCII mode they are equivalent to [0-9], [ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v], and [a-zA-Z0-9_].\n",
        "In Unicode mode they match certain other characters, as well. For instance, \\w matches letters with accents. Versions of these special sequences with __upper case letters - \\D, \\S, and \\W - mean the opposite to the lower-case versions__. For instance, \\D matches anything that isn't a digit.<br><br>\n",
        "Additional special sequences are __\\A, \\Z, and \\b__.\n",
        "The sequences \\A and \\Z match the beginning and end of a string, respectively.\n",
        "The sequence \\b matches the empty string between \\w and \\W characters, or \\w characters and the beginning or end of the string. <br>\n",
        "\\A is an anchor that says \"the string starts here\" so in other words no characters may occur before \\A\n",

        "\\Z is an anchor that says \"the string ends here\" so in other words no characters may occur after \\Z\n",
        "\n",
        "\\b matches 1 or more spaces and 0 or more letters (words). So in other words there must be at least 1 word to the left of \\b and at least 1 word to the right of \\b.<br>\n",
